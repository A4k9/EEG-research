**Abstract:** This chapter presents an Electroencephalography (EEG) based approach
for brain activity analysis on the Multi-Modal face dataset to provide an under-
standing for the visual response invoked in the brain upon seeing images of faces
(familiar, unfamiliar and scrambled faces) and applying computational modeling for
classification along with the removal/reduction of noise in the given channels. Thus
demonstrating the process of EEG analysis which may be used in various smart
health care applications.
